This App includes some extra results of paper *Excess mortality in Europe during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-country study at the sub-national level by G. Konstantinoudis et al. (2021)*. 

* Read carefully the **Introduction** before using the App.

* Estimates for certain age and sex groups at certain NUTS3 areas may be unstable, so you should interpret them with care or use higher levels of aggregation instead.
